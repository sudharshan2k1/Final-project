									<h2 class="major">Python</h2>
									<p>1.What is Python?<br>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.</p>
									<p>2.What is a dynamically typed language?<br>These are the languages that do not require any pre-defined data type for any variable as it is interpreted at runtime by the machine itself. In these languages, interpreters assign the data type to a variable at runtime depending on its value. We don’t even need to specify the type of variable that a function is returning or accepting in these languages. JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Perl, etc are examples of dynamically typed languages.</p>
									<p>3.What is PEP 8 and why is it important?<br>PEP-8 is an acronym for Python Enhancement Protocol 8, which is a set of guidelines published for the Python programming language. PEP-8 guidelines may seem pedantic, but following them can improve your code, especially when it comes to sharing your code, whether it is your potential employer or open-source contribution or during group Projects.</p>
									<p>4.What is Scope in Python?<br>The scope defines the accessibility of the python object. To access the particular variable in the code, the scope must be defined as it cannot be accessed from anywhere in the program. The particular coding region where variables are visible is known as scope</p>
									<p>5.What are lists and tuples?<br>Lists are just like dynamically sized arrays, declared in other languages. In simple language, a list is a collection of things, enclosed in [ ] and separated by commas.The list is a sequence data type which is used to store the collection of data.Tuple is a collection of objects separated by commas. In some ways, a tuple is similar to a list in terms of indexing, nested objects, and repetition but a tuple is immutable, unlike lists which are mutable.</p>
									<p>6.What are the common built-in data types in Python?<br>Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data. Since everything is an object in Python programming, data types are actually classes and variables are instance (object) of these classes.Numeric,Sequence Type,Boolean,Set,Dictionary are the types of common built in data types in python.</p>
									<p>7.What is pass in Python?<br>The pass statement is a null statement. But the difference between pass and comment is that comment is ignored by the interpreter whereas pass is not ignored. Sometimes, pass is used when the user doesn’t want any code to execute. So user can simply place pass where empty code is not allowed, like in loops, function definitions, class definitions, or in if statements. So using pass statement user avoids this error.</p>
									<p>8.what is lambda function?<br>LAMBDA function is first used to create a generic (unnamed) formula. Once a generic version has been created and tested, it is ported to the Name Manager, where it is formally defined and named. One of the key benefits of a custom LAMBDA function is that the logic contained in the formula exists in just one place.LAMBDA function is first used to create a generic (unnamed) formula. Once a generic version has been created and tested, it is ported to the Name Manager, where it is formally defined and named. One of the key benefits of a custom LAMBDA function is that the logic contained in the formula exists in just one place.</p>
									<p>9.What are Decorators in Python?<br>A decorator is a design pattern tool in Python for wrapping code around functions or classes (defined blocks). This design pattern allows a programmer to add new functionality to existing functions or classes without modifying the existing structure. The section provides an overview of what decorators are, how to decorate functions and classes, and what problem can it solve.</p>
									<p>10.How many Python Namespaces are there?<br>Python namespaces, the structures used to organize the symbolic names assigned to objects in a Python program.They are mainly four types of Namespaces exist.They are Built in,Global,Enclosing and Local Name Spaces.</p>

								<article id="SQL">
									<h2 class="major">SQL</h2>
									<p>1.What is SQL, and what is it used for?<br>SQL stands for Structured Query Language, which is a standard programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. SQL is commonly used for storing, manipulating, and retrieving data in databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and many others.SQL provides a set of commands for working with relational databases, including creating and modifying tables, inserting, updating, and deleting data, and querying data using a variety of criteria.</p>
									<p>2.What is a primary key, and why is it important?<br>A primary key is a field or combination of fields in a database table that uniquely identifies each record in the table. The primary key is used to enforce the integrity of the data in the table and ensure that each record can be uniquely identified and retrieved.In other words, the primary key is a special field in a database that uniquely identifies a specific record in a table.</p>
									<p>3.What are the different types of SQL joins?<br>They are mainly four types of joins are there in sql:-
										Inner Join: An inner join returns only the matching rows from both tables. In other words, it returns the intersection of the two tables based on a specified join condition.
										
										Left Join: A left join returns all the rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table. If there is no matching row in the right table, the result will contain NULL values.
										
										Right Join: A right join returns all the rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table. If there is no matching row in the left table, the result will contain NULL values.
										
										Full Outer Join: A full outer join returns all the rows from both tables, including the non-matching rows. If there is no matching row in one table, the result will contain NULL values for that table.</p>
									<p>4.What is normalization, and why is it important?<br>Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database in a way that reduces redundancy and dependency, and improves data consistency and accuracy. It involves breaking down a larger table into smaller, more specific tables, with relationships defined between them.Normalization helps to ensure that data in the database is consistent, as each piece of data is only stored in one place.Normalization helps to optimize query performance, as it eliminates redundant data and makes it easier to search for specific information. normalization helps to create a more efficient and manageable database, which can save time and effort in data management and improve the accuracy and consistency of data.</p>
									<p>5.What is an index, and how does it improve query performance?<br>In a database, an index is a data structure that is used to improve the performance of queries on a table by allowing the database engine to quickly find the data that matches the query criteria. An index is essentially a copy of a portion of a table's data that is stored in a separate structure, along with pointers to the corresponding rows in the table.When a query is executed on a table, the database engine can use the index to quickly locate the rows that match the query criteria, rather than having to scan the entire table. This can greatly improve the performance of queries, especially on large tables with many rows.Indexes can be created on one or more columns in a table, and can be unique or non-unique. Unique indexes ensure that each value in the indexed column(s) is unique, while non-unique indexes allow for duplicate values</p>
									<p>6.What is a trigger, and when would you use it?<br>A trigger is a set of instructions that are automatically executed in response to a specific event, such as an insert, update, or delete operation on a table. Triggers can be used to enforce business rules, maintain data integrity, and perform automated tasks.Triggers can be used to enforce business rules, such as requiring that a certain field be filled out or that certain values be within a certain range.Triggers can be used to track changes to a table, such as who made the change and when it was made.Triggers can be used to perform automated tasks, such as sending an email notification when a certain condition is met or updating a table based on a set of conditions.</p>
									<p>7.What is the difference between a clustered and non-clustered index?<br>Clustered index:A clustered index is an index that determines the physical order of the data in a table. When a table has a clustered index, the data is physically sorted and stored in the order specified by the index. A table can have only one clustered index, and it is typically created on the primary key column(s) of the table. When a query is executed on a table with a clustered index, the database engine can use the index to quickly locate the data that matches the query criteria.
										Non Clustered index: It is an index that does not determine the physical order of the data in a table. Instead, it is stored separately from the table and contains a copy of a portion of the table's data along with pointers to the corresponding rows in the table. A table can have multiple non-clustered indexes, and they are typically created on columns that are frequently used in queries but are not the primary key.</p>
									<p>8.What is the difference between a view and a table?<br>A view is a virtual table that is not stored physically in the database. It is a logical representation of one or more tables in the database that can be used to retrieve data from multiple tables as a single object. A view is a read-only object that does not contain any data itself.A table is a database object that stores data in a structured way, consisting of rows and columns. It is used to organize and store data for efficient retrieval, update, and deletion. A table is a fundamental object in a database management system (DBMS).</p>
									<p>9.What is a stored procedure, and when would you use it?<br>A stored procedure is a precompiled program that is stored in a database and can be executed on demand. It is a collection of SQL statements and procedural logic that can perform a specific task or set of tasks. Stored procedures can be precompiled and cached, which can improve execution times for frequently used tasks.Stored procedures can help enforce business rules and ensure consistent data entry and manipulation.Stored procedures are a powerful tool that can help improve the performance, security, and maintainability of database systems.</p>
									<p>10.What is a subquery, and when would you use it?<br>A subquery, also known as a nested query, is a query that is embedded within another query. The subquery is executed first, and the result of the subquery is used by the outer query to produce a final result set.Subqueries can be used to filter data based on specific criteria. For example, you might use a subquery to find all orders that include a specific product.Subqueries can be used to perform joins between tables. For example, you might use a subquery to find all customers who have made a purchase in the last month. Subqueries can be used to update or delete data based on specific criteria.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Data Structures</h2>
									<p>1.What is a data structure?<br>A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer program so that it can be accessed and manipulated efficiently. In other words, it is a particular way of organizing data in memory to facilitate its efficient use in algorithms and program design.There are many different types of data structures, including arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, and hash tables.</p>
									<p>2.What is the difference between an array and a linked list?<br>An array is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations. Each element in the array can be accessed using its index, which represents its position in the array. Because elements in an array are stored in contiguous memory locations, accessing an element using its index is very fast.
										Linked List:-
										A linked list is a collection of elements called nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node in the list. Because nodes in a linked list can be scattered throughout memory, accessing a particular node in the list requires traversing the list from the beginning until the desired node is found.</p>
									<P>3.What is a stack, and what is it used for?<br>A Stack is a linear data structure that allows data to be inserted and removed from only one end, called the top. It follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, which means that the last element added to the stack is the first element to be removed.
										<br>The operations that can be performed on a stack are:<br>
										Push: Insert an element at the top of the stack.<br>
										Pop: Remove the element at the top of the stack.<br>
										Peek: Get the element at the top of the stack without removing it.<br>
										IsEmpty: Check whether the stack is empty or not.<br>
										Stacks are used in compilers to evaluate expressions. Each operand and operator is pushed onto the stack, and the operators are evaluated in the correct order.</P>
									<p>4.What is a queue, and what is it used for?<br>A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue is the first element to be removed. A queue has two ends: the front, where elements are removed, and the rear, where elements are added.a queue is used to implement cache replacement algorithms. The data that is least recently used is removed from the front of the queue, and new data is added to the rear of the queue.</p>
									<P>5.What is a binary tree, and what is it used for?<br>A Binary tree is a tree-like data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. The topmost node of the tree is called the root, and the nodes without any children are called leaf nodes.Binary trees are used in a wide range of computer science applications, such as searching, sorting, and data compression.Binary search trees, for example, are binary trees in which the value of each node is greater than all the values in its left subtree and less than all the values in its right subtree.</P>
									<p>6.What is a hash table, and what is it used for?<br>A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. It is also known as a hash map, dictionary, or associative array. The hash function takes a key as input and returns an index into an array of values, where the value corresponding to that key can be found.Hash tables are commonly used in computer science for fast lookups, insertions, and deletions of key-value pairs. Hash tables are used in many different areas of computer science, including databases, compilers, web servers, and cryptography. They are often used for caching, indexing, and data compression, as well as for implementing data structures like sets and maps.</p>
									<p>7.What is a priority queue, and what is it used for?<br>A priority queue is an abstract data type that is similar to a queue, but instead of returning elements in the order they were added, it returns them in order of priority. Each element in the priority queue has an associated priority value, and higher priority elements are dequeued before lower priority elements.Element priorities: Each element in the priority queue has an associated priority value, which can be an integer, a real number, or any other comparable data type.</p>
									<P>8.What is a graph, and what is it used for?<br>A graph is a collection of nodes (also known as vertices) and edges that connect pairs of nodes. Graphs can be used to model a wide range of real-world systems, such as social networks, transportation networks, and electrical circuits.A graph is said to be connected if there is a path between any pair of nodes in the graph.</P>
									<p>9.What is the difference between BFS and DFS?<br>BFS (breadth-first search) is a graph traversal algorithm that visits all the nodes of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., it visits all the nodes at a given depth level before moving on to the next level. BFS starts at a specified node and visits all the nodes that are reachable from that node in breadth-first order.<br>
										DFS (depth-first search) is a graph traversal algorithm that visits all the nodes of a graph by exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. DFS starts at a specified node and visits all the nodes that are reachable from that node using a depth-first approach.</p>
									<P>10.What is the time complexity of different operations in a binary search tree?<br>The time complexity of operations in a binary search tree (BST) depends on the height of the tree. The height of a BST is the maximum number of edges between the root and a leaf node. the time complexity of BST operations depends on the balance of the tree. In a balanced BST, the height is logarithmic with respect to the number of nodes, leading to efficient operations. However, in a completely unbalanced BST, the height is equal to the number of nodes, leading to inefficient operations.</P>

									<h2 class="major">JAVA</h2>
									<p>1.What is java?<br>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that is widely used for developing various applications like desktop, mobile, web, and enterprise applications.</p>
									<p>2.What are the features of Java?<br>
											Platform independence
											Object-oriented programming support
											Memory management through garbage collection
											Strong type-checking and safe runtime environment
											Robust exception handling
											Multi-threading support</p>
									<p>3.What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?<br>JDK (Java Development Kit) is a software development environment that includes tools for developing, debugging, and monitoring Java applications. JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is a software package that provides the environment needed to run Java programs. JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed.</p>
									<p>4.What are the access modifiers in Java?<br>Public: can be accessed from anywhere
											Private: can only be accessed within the same class
											Protected: can be accessed within the same class or package, as well as subclasses
											Default: can be accessed within the same package</p>
									<p>5.What is the difference between abstract class and interface?<br>An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and can contain both abstract and non-abstract methods. An interface, on the other hand, is a collection of abstract methods that are implemented by a class. An interface can also contain constant variables, default methods, and static methods.</p>
									<p>6.What is a thread in Java?<br>A thread is a lightweight process that enables concurrent execution of multiple tasks within a single program. A Java program can have multiple threads that execute independently, and the Java runtime environment manages these threads.</p>
									<p>7.What is the difference between synchronized and volatile keyword in Java?<br>The synchronized keyword is used to provide mutual exclusion and ensure thread safety by allowing only one thread to access a critical section of code at a time. The volatile keyword is used to ensure that a variable is always read and written to the main memory, rather than to a thread's local memory.</p>
									<p>8.What is the difference between static and non-static methods in Java?<br>Static methods belong to a class, and they can be called without creating an instance of the class. Non-static methods belong to an object and can only be called on an instance of the class.</p>
									<p>9.What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList in Java?<br>An ArrayList is an implementation of the List interface that is backed by an array. It is better suited for accessing elements randomly and performing iterative operations like searching and sorting. A LinkedList is an implementation of the List interface that is backed by a doubly-linked list. It is better suited for inserting and deleting elements, especially in the middle of the list.</p>
									<p>10.What is the difference between final, finally, and finalize in Java?<br>Final is a keyword that is used to make a variable, method, or class constant and unmodifiable. Finally is a block of code that is used to execute regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not. Finalize is a method that is called by the garbage collector before an object is destroyed to perform any necessary cleanup actions.</p>

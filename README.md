# Welcome to My Project !


Hello Folks!! just had a thought, for practicing virtual interview.

Created a website for interview preparation and practice to get rig of nervous and helps you to find out loopholes 

TO Find a proper Face Expression detection used model.

Take live video from webcam with OpenCV.

 Use OpenCV haarcascades for face detection.

 Use ML model to predict expression.

 Integrate the model with the program.

 Build flask prototype.

 Make sure the flask app is running properly locally.

 Write client side javascript to take frames from the video to send to the server for detection.

 Handle the server response and draw on canvas proper bounding boxes.
